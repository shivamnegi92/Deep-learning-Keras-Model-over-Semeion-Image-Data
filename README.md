# Deep learning/Keras Model over Semeion Handwritten Digit Image Data

Prezi:https://prezi.com/p/r1lkzdza1ffr/

Data Set Information:
1593 handwritten digits from around 80 persons were scanned, stretched in a rectangular box 16x16 in a gray scale of 256 values.Then each pixel of each image was scaled into a bolean (1/0) value using a fixed threshold. 
Each person wrote on a paper all the digits from 0 to 9, twice. The commitment was to write the digit the first time in the normal way (trying to write each digit accurately) and the second time in a fast way (with no accuracy). 

Data Analysis:
Implemented Keras Machine Learing algorithm to develop a deep net trained on the test data
Trained the hyperparameters and performed model tuning by adjusting epoch and number of layers to optimize the outputs and make the performance better
Developed the model with a performance accuracy of around 96% which classify the nuumeric image data to a resultant value
